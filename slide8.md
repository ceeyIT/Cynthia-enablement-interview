## Integration Steps


- Use Packer Artifacts in Terraform

--

- Input Variables for Flexibility

--

- Automate the Workflow

???
As we integrate Packer and Terraform, it's important to understand the key steps in the process. First, we utilize Packer artifacts, such as the created machine images, directly within our Terraform configurations. This ensures seamless collaboration between the two tools. Additionally, leveraging input variables in Terraform provides flexibility in defining image IDs or other parameters dynamically. Finally, we automate the end-to-end workflow to enhance efficiency and maintain a smooth infrastructure provisioning process.
