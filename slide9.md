##  Packer-Terraform Integration Sample

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

variable "ami_id" {
  description = "AMI ID created by Packer"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = var.ami_id
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```
???
Here's a snippet of Terraform code showcasing integration with Packer artifacts. The variable block allows flexibility by defining an input variable for the AMI ID, which is created by Packer. This variable is then referenced in the aws_instance resource, ensuring that the latest machine image, generated by Packer, is used in the Terraform deployment. This integration enhances adaptability and maintains consistency across the infrastructure.
